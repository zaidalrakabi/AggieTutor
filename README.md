Individual Contributions:

- Dolly Ye: Created logo, launch screen, InitialViewController, MenuViewController,LoginViewController and SignUpViewController. InitialViewController allows users to skip the menu screen and jump to the dashboard if the user has previously logged in. MenuViewController lets users to either log in or sign up. SignUpViewController records the users' info into the Firebase.LoginViewController uses Firebase to authenticate user account. Set the UI (gradient blue) for the whole app.
- Zaid Al Rakabi: I managed the overall flow, features, and transitions of the app. In addition I implemented the Side Menu for easier navigation. I added My Profile, My Request, and My Jobs View Controllers to display User information and get data from Firebase. I also contributed to Available tutor's VC by adding the Tutor Detail View contoller.

## Testing Plan
1. Create prototype without any backend support, similar to the App Prototype above.
2. Demo prototype with friends. Get feedback on app aesthetics and user friendliness. 
3. Add Backend support with Firebase and third party Api's.
4. Demo second prototype with backend suppport and Api's. Get more feedback on funtionality of app and how realistic it is that people would use it.
